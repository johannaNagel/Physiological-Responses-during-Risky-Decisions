# Physiological-Responses-during-Risky-Decisions
Thie repository contains the code for the master thesis about the physiological responses during risky decisions.

The Abstract of the thesis:

Emotions and decisions influence each other. Emotional states shape choice behavior, while decisions themselves can trigger physiological responses. Building on this research, this study examines whether market mechanisms such as price volatility and deviations from fundamental value influence electrodermal activity (EDA) as an indicator of risk. Various statistical methods were used to examine whether high risk, operationalized by high volatility or large deviations from fundamental value, is associated with increased EDA during the decision-making process and whether this association depends on transaction type or decision phase. These results show weak associations between EDA and fundamental deviations, which became stronger in some cases when contextual factors were taken into account. Volatility, on the other hand, showed no systematic influence. Overall, the mechanisms had a slightly stronger effect on skin conductance rate and skin conductance level. Combined analyses revealed individual interaction effects, particularly in the case of purchases. Predictive models confirmed that EDA alone has limited value for risk prediction, but performance improves substantially when combined with price information and transaction variables.
